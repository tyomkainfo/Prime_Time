            <p>
                <strong>Overview</strong><br>
                This document describes the privacy policy of PrimTimeLive (the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”), with
                respect to the use of any of our websites, landing pages, web forms or applications, including the web
                user interface of the PrimTimeLive (collectively, the “Websites”). It covers our approach to collecting
                and managing personally identifiable information (“PII”) and other information (collectively,
                “Information”) obtained through your use of the Websites.<br><br><br>
                <strong>Consent</strong><br>
                By visiting our Websites you consent to our collection and use of your Information as described
                herein.<br>
                Information Collection<br>
            <ol>
                <li>Your email address is required to create a user account for access to the PrimTimeLive, and is the
                    only information we collect for access to the PrimTimeLive.
                </li>
                <li>Networking traffic data, which is anonymous information relating to pages visited, time spent at
                    pages, etc., that does not personally identify a website visitor. It usually includes the IP address
                    of the visitor’s network and identity of the website browser used, and may include the type of
                    operating system the visitor uses or other non-personal information.
                </li>
                <li>Voluntary self-identification information, including customer data containing name, address, email
                    address, telephone number, company and service interests; and job applicant information containing
                    name, address, email address, telephone number, gender, employment history and race/ethnicity. We
                    may also request additional information for optional online surveys and identification verification.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br><br><br>
            <strong>Information Use</strong><br>
            We collect Information for several business reasons:
            <ol>
                <li>To better understand your needs as a customer or potential customer;</li>
                <li>To improve our services, products and business operations and to engage in other business related
                    communication with you;
                </li>
                <li>To send you promotional communications containing information we think you will find interesting;
                </li>
                <li>To contact you to fill out surveys and participate in other types of market research;<</li>
                <li>To customize our Websites according to your online behavior and personal preferences; and</li>
                <li>To diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Websites more effectively.</li>
            </ol>
            <br><br>
            <strong>Information Use</strong><br>
            We may occasionally have a strategic business relationship with another company and choose to integrate a
            portion or version of our Websites, services, content or branding with those offered by that company. In
            such a case, we may agree to share your information with that company; however, we will do so only subject
            to strict confidentiality, use obligations and restrictions. Moreover, we will not disclose Information that
            is unnecessary to the relationship. We may also distribute to other parties for marketing and promotional
            purposes aggregate Company business Information from which you cannot be personally identified.<br>
            In the absence of a strategic relationship, and except while providing our services, we do not share your
            Information with any party without your express permission. We may disclose user Information in special
            cases when we have reason to believe it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring action against a party
            that may be causing injury to or interfering with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Company’s rights
            or property, other Website users, or any other party that could be harmed by such activities. We may
            disclose user Information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.<br><br>

            <strong>Security</strong><br>
            The security of your PII is important to us, and, although no method of information transmission or storage
            is 100% secure, we take significant precautions to protect your PII, including use of TLS encrypted
            communications for data sent between your browser and our website and other Internet accessible systems. You
            can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for “https” at the beginning of
            the address of the Web page.<br>
            While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your
            information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing
            or customer service) are granted access to PII. The computers/servers in which we store PII are kept in a
            secure environment and all data at rest is encrypted.<br>
            For PrimeTimeLive UI registration, we safely store this information in a cloud-based database for use by
            cloud-based Radius authentication servers. A cloud-based backup of this data will also be performed. A link
            to set up initial access to the PrimeTimeLive UI will be sent to your email address. Upon initial connection
            to the PrimeTimeLive UI you will be asked to create a unique username for the system. At that point your
            email address will be retained in the database for username/password recovery purposes. Additionally, your
            email address may be used in the event that one of our employees needs to contact you regarding your
            PrimeTimeLive UI account.<br>
            <strong>Cookies</strong><br>
            The Web framework upon which the PrimeTimeLive UI is built uses cookies to keep track of current user web
            sessions. As such, cookies must be enabled for our website to work; however, we do not store or read cookies
            for any other purpose.<br><br>

            <strong>Other</strong><br>
            The Company’s websites and online accessible systems may contain links to other websites. We are not
            responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites. Please be aware when you leave our site
            and read the privacy statements of any other site that collects PII.<br><br>

            of Company website or system content in violation of copyright, trademark and other applicable laws may
            result in criminal or civil penalties.<br><br>

            The Company’s graphics, logos and service names are our exclusive trademarks and servicemarks. These marks
            must not be used in any manner that disparages or discredits the Company or in connection with any product

            periodically. Your continued use of our services after we post any modifications to this privacy policy on

                LimitlessX is an agency with a primary focus on direct-to-consumer (DTC) products specialized in health,
                wellness, and other services that advocate for healthier living and self improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
                LimitlessX identified the distressed public company that specializes in mobile outdoor marketing as a
                way to leverage their existing infrastructure for advertising while also pursuing a path to entering the
                capital equity markets. By acquiring the distressed company, it enabled LimitlessX to take advantage of
                the equity capital markets while also benefiting from the company's existing advertising capabilities
                and use it to promote their own products or services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, this allowed LimitlessX to become publicly traded without the extreme time allocation it
                takes from the founders and employees to finalize and conduct a traditional IPO. As a result of the
                immediate access to the capital markets it opened a door for the company to immediately raise a little
                over $12,000,000. There are plans to expand the advertising companies website and continue evaluating if
                the business will be a viable integration to LimitlessX. The previou
